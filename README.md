## Scale Balancing Algorithm

The infamous Scale Balance Challenge! This solution dynamically calculates the balance between two sides using the available weights and intelligently assigns them to the correct scale pan. It also selects the simplest possible solution after evaluating all potential configurations in base-3 system ( left/right/none ). Try it out! Add or remove weights from the stock to test the algorithm.

## Smart Highlighting in Searches

A user-friendly search functionality designed for the search of complex strings, such as contract or registration numbers, which may include spaces or special-character separators like '-', '/', or '.'. The search normalizes these inputs into an alphanumeric format, allowing users to find results without worrying about exact formatting.
The challenge was to precisely highlight only the consecutive parts of the search, ignoring all separators. Try it out! Search for 'a-b/c','cba', or 'ccc'. Or add a new number.
