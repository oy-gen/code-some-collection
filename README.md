## Smart Highlighting in Searches

A user-friendly search functionality designed for the search of complex strings, such as contract or registration numbers, which may include spaces or special-character separators like '-', '/', or '.'. The search normalizes these inputs into an alphanumeric format, allowing users to find results without worrying about exact formatting.
The challenge was to precisely highlight only the consecutive parts of the search, ignoring all separators. Try it out! Search for 'a-b/c','cba', or 'ccc'. Or add a new number.
