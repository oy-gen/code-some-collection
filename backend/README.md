Running TypeScript Code
   You have two options for running your TypeScript code:

Compile and Run: Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (tsc) and then run the compiled JavaScript file:

npx tsc
node dist/index.js
Run Directly with ts-node: Use ts-node to execute TypeScript files without manual compilation:

npx ts-node src/index.ts
